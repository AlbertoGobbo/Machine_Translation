The aim of this project is to implement the Machine Translation task from English sentences to Italian ones, with the help of one specific Neural Network model, namely the *character-level Seq2Seq* one.

For computational reasons, the code has been implemented and executed in the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) environment.
